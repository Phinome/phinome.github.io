<p>Require a folder of files or other folders, instead of doing them one at a time.</p>

<h3 id="Why_should_you_care?">Why should you care?</h3><p>So let’s say you are setting up a node project, and using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">adapter pattern</a>, which is a great and useful pattern. You may have a folder full of adapters, and you want to require all of them into an object, rather than going through each one individually. Kind of like <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#the-require_tree-directive">require_tree in sprockets</a>. That’s exactly what indx does for you.</p>
<p>It’s a very small script, but it’s something I found myself writing and re-writing, so I figured why not wrap it up and give it to the world to make life a couple lines of code shorter.</p>
<h3 id="Installation">Installation</h3><p><code>npm install indx</code></p>
<h3 id="Usage">Usage</h3><p>In the folder you want to require, put an <code>index.js</code> file at the root. Inside that file, write this:</p>
<pre><code class="js"><span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'indx'</span>)(__dirname);
</code></pre>
<p>This you can require that folder and each of the files will be present. Alternately, just pass <code>indx</code> the path of a directory you want to require:</p>
<pre><code class="js"><span class="keyword">var</span> adapters = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'indx'</span>)(<span class="string">'./adapters'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The path you pass will be passed through <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_from_to">path.resolve</a>, so no need to compute an absolute path if you don’t need to. The example above will work fine without having to run any additional <code>path</code> methods on it as long as the relative path there is correct.</p>
<p>Indx supports javascript and coffeescript. If you have folders inside your folder, make sure each of those folders has an <code>index.js</code> or <code>index.coffee</code> file in it, or it won’t be required. If you have files in your folder that are not <code>.js</code> or <code>.coffee</code>, they will not be required. If there are other languages I’m not aware of you’d like to add support for, feel free to submit a pull request - it’s easy to extend the supported extensions.</p>

<p>This entire project is one file, pretty easy to figure out how it’s working. If you want to add something or fix a bug, please add a test for it. You can run tests with <code>mocha</code> in the root of the project.</p>
