<h1 id="This_is_an_OPEN_Open_Source_Project">This is an OPEN Open Source Project</h1><hr>
<h2 id="What?">What?</h2><p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given<br>commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is<br>more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.</p>
<h2 id="Rules">Rules</h2><p>There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No <code>--force</code> pushes</strong> or modifying the Git history in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Non-master branches</strong> ought to be used for ongoing work.</li>
<li><strong>External API changes and significant modifications</strong> ought to be subject<br>to an <strong>internal pull-request</strong> to solicit feedback from other contributors.</li>
<li>Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are <em>encouraged</em> for any other<br>non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.</li>
<li>For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active<br>contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh<br>in.</li>
<li>Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm test</code> locally before submitting your PR, to catch any easy to miss<br>style &amp; testing issues.  To diagnose test failures, there are two ways to<br>run a single test file:<ul>
<li><code>node_modules/.bin/taper tests/test-file.js</code> - run using the default<br><a href="https://github.com/nylen/taper"><code>taper</code></a> test reporter.</li>
<li><code>node tests/test-file.js</code> - view the raw<br><a href="https://testanything.org/">tap</a> output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Releases">Releases</h2><p>Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.</p>
<h2 id="Changes_to_this_arrangement">Changes to this arrangement</h2><p>This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be<br>subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have<br>something valuable to add or change.</p>
