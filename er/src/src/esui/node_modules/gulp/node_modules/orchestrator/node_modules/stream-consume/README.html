<h1 id="stream-consume">stream-consume</h1><p>A node module ensures a Readable stream continues flowing if it’s not piped to<br>another destination.</p>
<pre><code>npm <span class="keyword">install</span> stream-consume
</code></pre><h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2><p>Simply pass a stream to <code>stream-consume</code>.<br>Both legacy streams and streams2 are supported.</p>
<pre><code class="js"><span class="keyword">var</span> consume = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'stream-consume'</span>);

consume(readableStream);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="Details">Details</h2><p>Only Readable streams are processed (as determined by presence of <code>readable</code><br>property and a <code>resume</code> property that is a function). If called with anything<br>else, it’s a NOP.</p>
<p>For a streams2 stream (as determined by presence of a <code>_readableState</code><br>property), nothing is done if the stream has already been piped to at least<br>one other destination.</p>
<p><code>resume()</code> is used to cause the stream to continue flowing.</p>
